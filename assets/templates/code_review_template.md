# Code Review Report: [What's being reviewed]

> **CRITICAL: Issue Consistency Rule**
>
> Everything in this review is EITHER:
>
> - ✅ Good/Pass - No action needed
> - OR it's a tracked issue: `[issue_X emoji]` where emoji = ❌ Blocking, ⚠️ Important, ℹ️ Optional, 🦋 Cosmetic
>
> For example, if a severe issue is found in code quality, it should be tagged as "[issue_7 ❌]" in the Code Quality section, then also appear in the Bottom Line table with the same tag, be counted in the Executive Summary, and have a recommendation in the Recommendations section.
>
> **NO standalone warnings, concerns, or recommendations without issue tracking.**
>
> Every issue MUST appear in: (1) First mention in detailed sections, (2) Bottom Line table, (3) Summary Table Status column, (4) Executive Summary count, (5) Recommendations section.
>
> [Remove this note when review is done and all issues are tracked consistently]

## Consistency Checklist [Remove when review is done]

Before finalizing this review, verify:

- [ ] Every issue uses format `[issue_X emoji]` consistently throughout
- [ ] No standalone ⚠️ warnings exist without an issue tag
- [ ] Issue count in Executive Summary matches Bottom Line table row count
- [ ] Every issue in Bottom Line appears in Summary Table (in relevant aspect rows with Status column)
- [ ] Every issue in Bottom Line has a recommendation listed in Recommendations section
- [ ] All "not perfect" items (warnings, concerns, partial implementations) are tracked as issues
