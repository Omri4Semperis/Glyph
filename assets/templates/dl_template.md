## Background

[Provide context about the current state of the system, why this feature/research is needed, and any relevant history. For research: include what is currently known and unknown. For implementation: describe the current system state.]

## Problem

[Clearly state what problem you're trying to solve or what you need to understand. For research: frame as questions to answer or hypotheses to validate. For implementation: specify requirements and constraints.]

## Questions and Answers

[AI assistant will ask questions here. Add answers below each question. Keep questions even after answering - they provide valuable context.]

**Q: [Question from AI assistant]**
A: [User will provide the answer here]

## Design

[For implementation: Describe the proposed solution in detail. Include file paths, type signatures, data structures, API endpoints, etc. For research: Describe the research methodology, data sources, analysis approach, etc. Remove subsections below that are not applicable.]

### Architecture / Research Design

[For implementation: High-level architecture description, optionally with a diagram. For research: Describe research methodology, data collection approach, analysis framework.]

### Database Schema

[Implementation only: If applicable, describe database changes. Remove this section if not applicable.]

### API Endpoints

[Implementation only: If applicable, describe API changes. Remove this section if not applicable.]

### File Structure

[Implementation only: Where will new/modified files live? Remove this section if not applicable.]

### Type Signatures

[Implementation only: If using TypeScript or similar, include type definitions. Remove this section if not applicable.]

## Plan

[Break down the work into phases. For implementation: describe implementation phases. For research: describe research phases (literature review, data collection, analysis, synthesis). If more details are required, create one or more operation markdown documents using Glyph's tool.]

## Examples

[Implementation only: Show good and bad coding patterns with code examples. For research: provide example data, analysis outputs, or findings. Remove this section if not applicable.]

## Trade-offs

[Discuss alternatives considered and why you chose this approach. For implementation: technical trade-offs, architecture choices. For research: methodology choices, data source trade-offs, analysis approach alternatives.]

## Verification Criteria

[How do we know this work solves the original problem? For implementation: list acceptance criteria, test requirements, performance targets. For research: define what answers the research questions, validation methods for findings.]
